# Criteria
## Is hot reloading supported? 
Yes - no need to F5 and you don't lose state!

## Is time-travel debugging of state supported? 

## What browser extensions are available to support development? 

## How valuable are console warnings and errors? 
Better than ExtJS thus far - much clearer where the error is.  And when running dev using built-in webserver, it happens on save of file, thanks to hot reloading.

## What is the debugging experience like using dev tools? 


## What code editors / IDEs are supported or recommended? 
For VSCode - Vetur Extension https://github.com/vuejs/vetur (syntax highlighting, auto-completion, etc..)
