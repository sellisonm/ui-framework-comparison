# ui-framework-comparison

The goal of *ui-framework-comparison* is to provide an objective, criteria-based evaluation of today's most popular JavaScript UI frameworks and libraries. This project is not intended to make a recommendation, but instead to provide you, your team or your organization with the research and demos necessary to come to an informed conclusion. There is no *"one size fits all"* answer in todays front-end environment, but more often than not any of the candidates can be setup to suit your needs.

## Current Candidates

### [Angular](/angular) 
*One framework. Mobile & desktop.* ([more](/angular)) 

### [React](/react) 
*A JavaScript library for building user interfaces* ([more](/react)) 

### [Vue.js](/vuejs) 
*The Progressive JavaScript Framework* ([more](/vuejs))
